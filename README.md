# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe with AI ðŸ§ ðŸŽ®

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game offers both Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI modes with a polished graphical interface.

## Features
- **Player vs Player Mode:** Play locally with a friend.
- **Unbeatable AI Mode:** Challenge an AI that always makes the optimal move.
- **Graphical Interface:** A visually interactive game board created using `pygame`.
- **Efficient AI:** The AI uses alpha-beta pruning to minimize unnecessary evaluations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pygame:** For rendering the graphical interface.
- **NumPy:** For efficient board state management.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ssantiago065/TicTacToe.git && cd TicTacToe`
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended): `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game: `python TicTacToe.py`
